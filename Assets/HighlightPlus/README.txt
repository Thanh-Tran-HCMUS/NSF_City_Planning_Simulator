Quick help: how to use this asset?
----------------------------------

1) Highlighting specific objects: add HighlightEffect.cs script to any GameObject. Customize the appearance options.
  In the Highlight Effect inspector, you can specify which objects, in addition to this one, are also affected by the effect:
    a) Only this object
    b) This object and its children
    c) All objects from the root to the children
    d) All objects belonging to a layer

2) Control highlight effect when mouse is over:
  Add HighlightTrigger.cs script to the GameObject. It will activate highlight on the gameobject when mouse pass over it.

3) Highlighting any object in the scene:
  Select top menu GameObject -> Effects -> Highlight Plus -> Create Manager.
  Customize appearance and behaviour of Highlight Manager. Those settings are default settings for all objects. If you want different settings for certain objects just add another HighlightEffect script to each different object. The manager will use those settings.

4) Make transparent shaders compatible with See-Through effect:
  If you want the See-Through effect be seen through other transparent objects, they need to be modified so they write to depth buffer (by default transparent objects do not write to z-buffer).
  To do so, select top menu GameObject -> Effects -> Highlight Plus -> Add Depth To Transparent Object.

5) Static batching:
  Objects marked as "static" need a MeshCollider in order to be highlighted. This is because Unity combines the meshes of static objects so it's not possible to highlight individual objects if their meshes are combined.
  To allow highlighting static objects make sure they have a MeshCollider attached (the MeshCollider can be disabled).

Universal Rendering Pipeline
----------------------------

Customers can download a specific version of Highlight Plus designed for Universal Rendering Pipeline for free from our support forum on https://kronnect.com
Please sign up on the forum and send a pm to "Kronnect" or email to contact@kronnect.com to get access to the private board.

The Unity Asset Store currently does not allow you to select which package according to the pipeline to download so we have to offer this way so you can download it.


Future updates
--------------

All our assets follow an incremental development process by which a few beta releases are published on our support forum (kronnect.com).
We encourage you to signup and engage our forum. The forum is the primary support and feature discussions medium.

Of course, all updates of Highlight Plus will be eventually available on the Asset Store.
